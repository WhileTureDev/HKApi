# Dashboard Architecture and Features Plan

## Overview
The dashboard serves as the central hub for developers to manage their projects, namespaces, and API configurations. This document outlines the architecture and planned features from a developer's perspective.

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
1. **Component Structure**
   - `DashboardLayout`: Main layout component with navigation and common elements
   - `ProjectList`: List and manage projects
   - `ProjectDetails`: Detailed view of a single project
   - `NamespaceManager`: Manage namespaces within a project
   - `APIMetrics`: Display API usage metrics and statistics

2. **State Management**
   - Session-based authentication
   - Project and namespace data caching
   - Real-time updates for metrics

3. **API Integration**
   - RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
   - WebSocket connections for real-time updates
   - Token-based authentication

### Backend Architecture
1. **API Endpoints**
   ```
   /api/v1/
   ├── projects/
   │   ├── GET / - List projects
   │   ├── POST / - Create project
   │   ├── GET /{id} - Get project details
   │   ├── PUT /{id} - Update project
   │   └── DELETE /{id} - Delete project
   ├── namespaces/
   │   ├── GET / - List namespaces
   │   └── [Similar CRUD operations]
   └── metrics/
       ├── GET /usage - API usage metrics
       └── GET /performance - Performance metrics
   ```

2. **Database Schema**
   - Projects
   - Namespaces
   - User-Project relationships
   - API Keys
   - Usage Metrics

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1 - Core Features
1. ✅ Basic authentication and project listing
2. Project CRUD operations
3. Basic namespace management
4. API key management

### Phase 2 - Developer Experience
1. API testing interface
2. Basic metrics and monitoring
3. Documentation integration
4. Error tracking

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features
1. Team collaboration
2. Advanced security features
3. Custom alerts
4. CI/CD integration

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize database queries
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Implement WebSocket for real-time updates

### Security
- Regular security audits
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention

### Scalability
- Microservices architecture
- Load balancing
- Database sharding strategy
- Caching strategy

### Monitoring
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Usage analytics
- Health checks

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Follow MVC pattern
- Use TypeScript for frontend
- Implement comprehensive testing
- Document all APIs
- Use consistent coding style

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for API
- End-to-end testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing

### Documentation
- API documentation
- Code documentation
- Architecture documentation
- Deployment guides
- User guides

## Future Considerations
1. Mobile app support
2. GraphQL API
3. Machine learning for anomaly detection
4. Automated optimization suggestions
5. Extended marketplace for integrations
